      <p class="subtitleparabout"> Concept<p>

      <p class="parabout">

        <br> In the past months, in many countries, there have been
        big manifestations. Protesting has been more than a legal right, it has
        been an opportunity to shout out loud and express what has been difficult
        to say by other means. Most of the protest are preceded by a general
        feeling of discontent, usually accumulated by years of governments that
        overstepped people’s rights. It’s then a call out when people can not
        stand this kind of trait anymore. Either mass movements or individual
        self-expression, they all are aiming one special request, they just want
        to be heard.
        </br>
        <br> Protest has many forms, many symbols and many ways that people use
        in the attempt of cause a certain disruption in order to boost desired
        and needed changes on society. Even though they mean to be peaceful,
        protests usually encounter many obstacles along the way. Many turn into
        violence, finding several confrontations with the public force or, very
        often, being stigmatised by means of communication. This fight commonly
        leads a protest to cease.</br>
        <br> This situation is terrible for the people living in those countries.
        But what about the people living abroad that want to show their support?
        They feel they cannot do much to help them in their fight. But what about
        giving their support by a form of virtual activism. What if they can
        support their fights from all over the world without facing the obstacle
        of being far away in a physical way?</br>
</p>

      <p class="subtitleparabout"> Our Project<p>

      <p class="parabout">
        <br> Our website aims to be a place that allows people
        living abroad, to be part of the movement. We are convinced that people
        should have the right to be part of all the initiatives happening in the
        world. We want to give them a voice, to make them be heard, to let them
        be louder.</br>
        <br>The question is how are we going to achieve that. Hopefully,
        protests are creative catalysis, where “people’s desire to feel part of
        something much bigger than themselves is what drives them to find new
        means of protesting collectively”. Here is where things like the
        “cacerolazo” appear.</br>
        <br> Caserolazo cames from the Spanish word “cacerola” that means pot.
        One of the main elements people is using to show their discomfort is the
        sound of banged pots. The cacerolazo consists of a group of people making
        noise by banging pots, pans and other kitchen utensils in order to call
        for attention.</br>
        <br>This sound is going to be the main element, the <strong>symbol</strong>
        used to join these movements in a <strong>pacific way</strong>.</br>
