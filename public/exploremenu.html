      <p>"The protests in Chile consist of a series of demonstrations and
        riots originated in Santiago de Chile. These are taking place since
        the 18th of October of 2019. The first one was driven by secondary
        students but rapidly different social actors joined all over the country.
        <br> The main reasons for the mobilizations are the growth of social
        inequality over the years, the increased prices of basic services, the
        health system and the unfairness of pensions of the retired people." </br>

    <p>"Colombia is being active in demonstrations since the end of 2019. The
      first big protest took place on the 21 of November in several cities at
      the same time.
      <br> The general discontent of the current government was one of the main
      drivers of the protest. However, one of the most important was the breach
      of the peace pact signed three years ago ending the 50 years of arm conflict.
      Along with this, the new social, economic and environmental policies and
      reforms, the killings of indigenous and social leaders and the civilian
      deaths caused by the military force, among others."</br>

    <p>"Hong Kong has been involved in several demonstrations since the 31 of March 2019.
      <br> What initiated the demonstrations was the Legislative process of 2019 Hong Kong
      extradition bill, but nowadays, the protests include other issues such as demands
      for democratic reform and the Causeway Bay Books disappearances."</br>

    <p>"Lebanon demonstrations have been taking place since 17 October 2019.
      The first protest was held by a small group of people in Beirut but
      rapidly expended to the rest of the country.
      <br> The main reasons for the mobilizations are economic stagnant, unemployment,
      endemic corruption in the public sector, and failures from the government to
      provide basic services to the population."</br>
