      <p class="subtitleparabout"> What triggered the protests?
        <p>
          <p class="parabout">
            The protests in Colombia first started as an encounter of social
            movements and the labor union. The initial reasons were triggered
            by the initiatives and new reforms proposed by the current government
            like reducing the minimum wage for young people salaries, eliminating
            the pension system and privatizing public enterprises. However, this
            was just the tip of the iceberg, because beneath of it there was an
            accumulated feeling of unfairness and rage caused by a long list
            of failing promises and injustices.
            <br> And yet, the protest reached its breaking point when an authorized
            bombing ended up killing eight innocent children. The government
            claim that they were part of the guerrillas, so it was completely
            argued. This event unleashed the rage of the population that was
            already tired of being failed with the promises of the end of an
            armed conflict that seems not to have any end. Along with it, many
            social leaders are killed almost every day by insurgent forces that
            has coincidentally increased with the election of the current
            president, who is member of an extreme right party who has been
            implicated in serious accusations of corruption, illicit enrichment,
            paramilitary accusations and alleged killings and even massacres.

          <p class="subtitleparabout"> What do people aim with the protests? </p>

              <p class="parabout">
                Colombia, unlike other countries of Latin in America, has been
                indifferent to the social protest, in part because it has been
                stigmatized. However, the last protest held on the 21 of November
                was, a thrilling awakening. But, why? most of all, because
                Colombians couldn’t stand anymore the injustice and the accumulated
                unfair harm. Being one of the most unequal of all Latin American
                countries where just 1% of the richest people own the 80% of the
                territory. Where the corruption steals 2000 millions USD every
                year. Where having a different opinion and fight for it makes you
                get killed. Where an ever going armed conflict has taken more
                lives than all the Latin American dictatorships together. Because
                they’re claiming the right to get to live in peace.

              <p class="subtitleparabout"> What are the consequences of the protests? <p>

                  <p class="parabout">
                    Among the consequences of the protest, further than the
                    physical damages on several cities and blockages, there were
                    also violence initiated by the government who sent the
                    police riot to diminish and dissolve the protest, but ended
                    up stigmatizing the pacific protest. The repression and the
                    violence resulted in several detentions and missing people
                    and a general rejection to this police force. Regardless of
                    it, there was an important shift of the public opinion,
                    followed by a dramatic drop of the positive image of the
                    current government reaching its lower percentage to a 10%
                    of approval. It was a real awakening, because there weren’t
                    precedents of a movement like that. Full of creativity, the
                    protest  joined Colombians together because of different reasons
                    but aiming one cause, they wouldn’t want to be silent anymore.

                      <p class="subtitleparabout"> Colombia now <p>
                          <p class="parabout">The big protest was followed by
                            multiple expressions that maintained the protest
                            alive for more than two weeks, one of them called
                            the “cacerolazo” joined people from different ages
                            and places by hitting pans and bowls in order to
                            continue the protest in a pacific way. Soon after,
                            a curfew was decreed followed by a strategy rooted
                            in panic, where the government managed to gradually
                            decrease the participants on the protest. After that,
                            the protest stopped in December because there were no
                            guarantees from the government to set the dialogue.
                            <br> Apparently nothing changed regarding the claims
                            that were made, the government didn’t listen to the
                            requests that people made and right now Colombia is
                            facing the approval of many policies that was, on
                            firsthand, the principal reasons why the strike started.
                            People are trying to resume the protest, but it hasn’t
                            been successful because it has turned into violence and
                            not so many people are joining again.
