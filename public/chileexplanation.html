        <p>
          <p class="parabout">
            Chile was just like an oasis, that seems to be the only Latin American
            country that shows a strong economy and stability, but as well as
            most oasis, it turned out to be a mirage.

          <p class="subtitleparabout"> What triggered the protests? </p>

          <p class="parabout">
            The crisis initiated when, by recommendation of a public transportation
            panel, the president Sebastián Piñera decided to increase the cost of
            the ticket of metro, reaching its maximum value to 830 pesos (approx.
            1,17USD). Some experts affirmed that the rate hike is just the tip
            of the iceberg, because what is really behind all of it is the inequality
            that has been the center of the main debate of the latest days,
            insisting that Chilean social gap is disproportionate, even though
            Chile has the strongest economy of Latin American countries.  It’s
            also a cumulative discontent, where the 30 pesos of a metro ticket
            has unleashed the uneasiness of 30 years of a failing democracy that
            nowadays follow the same constitution that left the dictatorship of
            Pinochet.

  <p class="subtitleparabout"> What do people aim with the protests?<p>

          <p class="parabout"> People were originally protesting because, though
            there has been a growth of the middle class, it is actually a precarious
            middle class, where there are lower pensions, high levels of debt and
            salary doesn’t represent anything compared to the expenses. So it
            turns out to be a situation of daily uncertainty.
            <br> But, even though it was an argued petition, the government
            responded with such force, that people ended up remembering the days
            of the dictatorship where many people was unfairly killed because of
            it. After days of protest, President Piñera imposed a state of
            emergency and a curfew, sending over 10.000 soldiers to the streets
            with armed vehicles.</br>

            <br> The state of emergency was lifted, and yet the police are still
            taking violent action against people. Since then 20 people have died,
            1000 were injured and more than 3500 has been arrested. The public
            opinion is now pushing for the impeachment of Pinera if he doesn’t
            listen to people and a “constituent assembly” for a new constitution,
            along with their original requests.
            </br>

              <p class="subtitleparabout"> What are the consequences of the protests?<p>

                  <p class="parabout">
                    First of all, one of the big consequences has been the deep
                    distrust of the current political class and Pinera’s
                    administration. Chile’s president failed constantly
                    understanding people claims turning the protest into what
                    he himself called publicly: “a war”. Since then the number
                    of deaths, detentions, tortures and injured has rose up to
                    thousands, and the government has been denouncing a systematic
                    violation of people’s rights, whether they protested or not.
                    <br> After a month, this turns out to be the most sustained
                    protests Chile has seen since the end of military dictatorship,
                    and this marks a precedent not only for Latin America, but
                    to the world. People has managed to push the president to
                    delivered his final concession: rewrite the country’s
                    constitution.
                    </br>
                  </p>

                  </div>

                  <p class="subtitleparabout"> Chile now <p>
                      <p class="parabout"> The general feeling right now could
                        be called: “uncertainty”, because even if the new
                        constitution gets rewritten, there’s no guarantee of
                        Chile being again what it once was. What people are
                        protesting for, is really a complaint built up over
                        generations that finally are being told. But that’s
                        also the big  problem, those issues couldn’t be solve
                        only with the promise of a new constitution, it needs
                        most of all, time, something that President Pinera
                        seems not to have. Hence, as many other countries,
                        the Chilean protest is because of an historical widespread
                        inequality, even though Chile was the one apparently safest
                        country among a turbulent Latin America. This protest has
                        shown to the world, how if this matters are not taking
                        into account carefully, the same mistakes could be
                        repeated elsewhere. Which is actually the irony, because
                        is the rooted reason why some other countries are
                        protesting as well.
