          <p class="parabout">
            The conflict in Hong Kong, which began as a peaceful demonstration
            to protect themselves against a bill to reform the law, ended up
            becoming a symbol of the defence of democracy and Hong Kong’s Constitution.
            <br> Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. It has its
            own currency, a political system and their own cultural identity, which
            is different from those in mainland of China. This relationship of
            'independent belonging' is foreseen by the formula "One China, two
            systems", an expression which indicates the negotiated solution for
            the return of Hong Kong under Chinese jurisdiction the year 2047.
            </br>
            <br> Today, Hong Kong's legal system still reflects the British model
            and insists on transparency and fair trial. The principles are guaranteed
            by the constitution, the Basic Law, which is based on common law and
            protects rights other than those of the mainland Chinese. Among them
            are the right to protest, free press and free speech. In general,
            the law also establishes that the city has "a high degree of autonomy"
            in all fields except foreign policy and defence. But many residents
            claim that Beijing is violating these rights in a perceptible way.
            </br>
          </p>

          <p class="subtitleparabout"> What triggered the protests? </p>

              <p class="parabout">
                The first wave of protests occurred in 2014 when China announced
                that they wanted to reform the region's electoral system. The
                protests lasted nearly three months, and it was called "umbrella
                uprising". The proposal, which was not adopted, was perceived as
                an extremely restrictive measure of the autonomy of the region
                since it entailed the equivalent of a "pre-selection" of
                candidates for leadership in Hong Kong by the Chinese
                Communist Party (CCP).

                </div>

              <p class="parabout"> The current protests in Hong Kong have part of their origin
              in the Umbrella Revolution. Both protests have young people as
              promoters and main protesters, but in the Umbrella Revolution,
              the Hong Kong people took to the streets to demand universal
              suffrage and direct election of the local government, while in
              the current protests they began with a project of law reform.

                <br> The mobilizations began the 31st March 2019 as a protest
                against the proposed reform of the Extradition Law, presented
                by the Carrie Lam government, that proposed that China could
                judge Hong Kong criminals. </br>

                <br> The extradition law is the practice whereby a state
                surrenders to another state an individual who is in his
                territory, but who is subject to criminal prosecution in the
                other. The amendment would have forced the region to hand
                over people investigated from Beijing to China for certain
                crimes. However, the Hongkongers did not agree and understood
                the risk of human rights violations, and the use of extradition
                by the Chinese as a pretext to reach the political dissidents
                who took refuge in Hong Kong.
                </br>

                <br> Street protests officially began on June 9, with a
                million people taking to the streets. It was a series of
                peaceful rallies and demonstrations in the streets. Tired of
                not observing much government reaction, some groups broke
                into Parliament.
                </br>

                <br> In summer marches became increasingly frequent.
                Protesters closed the city airport, considered a key point
                for their safety and to get their message to the international
                community and the police began trying to stop protesters
                throwing eggs, bricks and Molotov cocktails with tear gas,
                air shots (which wounded a man) and water cannons.
                </br>
                <br> In a rather clever and technological way. Thousands in
                recent months have used protest "means" never seen before:
                among others, lasers and gas masks to avoid facial recognition;
                chat via Telegram to circumvent Chinese digital surveillance;
                manga-style posters circulated virally on the net; street
                skittles and water to put out the smoke.

              <p class="subtitleparabout"> What do people aim with the protests?<p>

                  <p class="parabout">
                    At first, the protests were focused on asking that this
                    reform not to be carried out, but as time went by, the
                    claims were mutated towards the reinforcement of its
                    Basic Law, its constitution model.
                    <br> The protesters made five main requests: to withdraw
                    the bill that envisages extradition to China (which took
                    place on 24 October); the resignation of the head of the
                    Hong Kong executive, Carrie Lam; an investigation into
                    the brutality expressed by the police during the protests;
                    the release of those who have been arrested; more
                    democratic freedoms.
                    </br>
                  </p>

                  <p class="subtitleparabout"> What are the consequences of the protests?<p>

                      <p class="parabout">
                        Mainland China is Hong Kong's main trading partner,
                        but the city is primarily an international economic
                        and financial centre. According to the American Chamber
                        of Commerce in Hong Kong, several companies have reported
                        "serious consequences of the outage", including disruption
                        of supply chains. Hong Kong companies, have also come
                        under pressure and have been accused of sympathizing
                        with the protesters.
                        <br> The cancelled flights have represented damage
                        to the companies operating in the financial hub. The
                        airport contributes 5% of the city's GDP. Over 74
                        million passengers travelled to and from Hong Kong
                        last year. The airport operates 1,100 passenger and
                        freight flights every day and serves around 200
                        destinations worldwide.
                        </br>

                      </div>

                      <p class="subtitleparabout"> Hong Kong now <p>
                          <p class="parabout"> Beijing leaders do not seem to
                            have the slightest intention of accepting the
                            activists' requests. Although Hong Kong is a special
                            case in China, accepting the demands of protesters
                            would mean not only taking the risk that someone
                            unwelcome comes to power but would also create a
                            dangerous precedent: the possibility of a democratic
                            change in the rest of the country, which would thus
                            endanger the regime's absolute authority.
                            <br> Protesters ask to be heard and that the police
                            account for what they consider brutality. So far
                            6,500 people have been arrested, only the first
                            day of this year were more than 400 arrests. The
                            underlying problem will remain latent.
